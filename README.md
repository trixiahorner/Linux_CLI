# Detecting backdoor threats via Linux CLI

This lab is provided by Antisyphon Training's SOC Core Skills course. We will explore the setup and detection of backdoor malware using a netcat listener, a common tool for establishing unauthorized remote access. The exercise aims to simulate a real-world cyber threat scenario, providing hands-on experience in malware analysis and defense techniques. By leveraging the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), we will detect and analyze the backdoor. 


# Conclusion
This lab is crucial for understanding the behavior of backdoor malware and the methodologies used to identify and respond to such threats effectively.
